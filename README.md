# Dark Sage

DARK SAGE is a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, focussed on detailing the structure and evolution of galaxies' discs.  The code-base is an extension of [SAGE](https://github.com/darrencroton/sage/) (Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution).  The model is described in full in the paper by [Stevens, Croton & Mutch (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.461..859S).

DARK SAGE will run on any N-body simulation whose trees are organised in a supported format and contain a minimum set of basic halo properties.  Galaxy formation models built using DARK SAGE on the Millennium simulation can be downloaded at the [Theoretical Astrophysical Observatory (TAO)](https://tao.asvo.org.au/).

The code-base, written in C, should function as is, provided the required dependencies are installed.

# The code-base is currently being tidied and optimised for a more streamlined public user experience.
